# TwitterScanner
This module will scan twitter live, and catalogue relavant cybersecurity information.
 It is mostly incomplete and will need to have more information gathered, such as documents, proofs of concepts, sandboxes, etc. These pose problems though as saving direct documents from twitter may result in security concerns for analysts studying this information. 
Install dependencies, and then run simply with npm run-script dev 

Example output included in examples.
